Commitment means when things a great you push your roots deeper and when things are hard you get to work together. Love canâ€™t sustain you in hard times. Sorry. No matter how much you love your partner the pain of watching them wither away during chemo & radiation is immense. Watching them go through bouts of depression after changing careers or when those you consider close friends abandon you on a dime because of what someone says about you. It takes more than love.

You aren't going to love your spouse the whole time. Let's get real for a moment. This is the part that gets folks tripped up. The "I'll love you forever." Part of the vows many people do in their wedding ceremonies is garbage at best. A wonderful sentiment. How do you know who your spouse will be after y'all have kids? Go financially broke? Lose your or their parents? Get cancer or some other terminal or life threatening illness? I could go on. The childish "love" most folks rely on is at best surface deep and boils down to good/great sex and financial support/partnership.
