Commitment means when things a great you push your roots deeper and when things are hard you get to work together. Love canâ€™t sustain you in hard times. Sorry. No matter how much you love your partner the pain of watching them wither away during chemo & radiation is immense. Watching them go through bouts of depression after changing careers or when those you consider close friends abandon you on a dime because of what someone says about you. It takes more than love.
